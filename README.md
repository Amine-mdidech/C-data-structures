# C-data-structures
Stack, Priority Queue, and a Tree
So, this is a little project that I have coded using C in which there is a stack with some tests
a priority queue wit tests too
Finally, the project tree which i coded with come friends a while ago using C. this one was a bit challenging as
any help concerning a tree is hard to find out on the internet especially for C language, ( there is for c++, hard to find for c )

I also did many other data structures like reversed Linked lists, Circular linked lists, Hash, a graph and binary Search trees. 
However I couldn't find them in any of my clouds or ancient hard drives. I will push them the moment I find them.
